This code defines a class called "Sorting" which contains two methods: "getArray" and "sortArray". The "getArray" method prompts the user to enter 5 unsorted integers and returns an integer array of length 5 containing those integers. The "sortArray" method takes an integer array as input and sorts it in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The sorted array is then returned.
